A live web chat. No client-side javascript, cookies, accounts, or `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` tags.

Instead, your browser never finishes loading the whole page, and downloads messages as they are posted by others.

Authentification is done with a password/tripcode system using PBKDF2 hashes.

## Try it by visiting [chat.justhack.in](https://chat.justhack.in)

**It's easy to self-host, and simple to use.** Developed with a security-first mentality.

Run ZeroChat in just a [few commands with Docker](#self-hosting-with-docker)!

#### Username and Password? But no accounts required!
- You can login using a handle of your choosing, and enter a "passcode" which is hashed into a unique "tripcode" for your passcode only
- A passcode is like a password, but no accounts are needed to enter a room, everyone just proves who they are by their tripcode

#### Rooms
- Choose from a preselected list of "public" rooms that are advertised on the front page by clicking the Room textbox twice. 
- Or, enter any name you want for your room, and you'll "tune" into it like a radio frequency.

You can share a link with `/roomName` at the end of the URL to have your friends join that room.

## Setup & Dependencies

This project requires NodeJS to run, unless you download one of the precompiled binary [releases](https://github.com/rslay/ZeroChat/releases) (Supported only on windows).

**There are three different ways to run ZeroChat, read below.**

### Setup ZeroChat on Windows

Download from the [releases](https://github.com/rslay/ZeroChat/releases) for executable binaries if you just want to run the chat server.

If you want to tweak the program and run the source code on Windows with/without docker, continue below.

### Self hosting setup with Docker

Run `docker compose --env-file .env.example up`.

`docker ps` should show you that the service is running!

Stop the service by running `docker compose down`.

#### Customizing

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and use that if you'd like to change things.

Keep in mind that if you change the `PORT`, you should change the `EXPOSE` value in the `Dockerfile` and forwarded port in the `docker-compose.yml`.

### Self Hosting setup without Docker

All you need is `node`, which comes with `npm`.

Run the following to install the wonderful [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installing-and-updating) (for windows, [windows-nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)) NodeJS version manager.

Then install NodeJS v16.2.0:

```bash
nvm install 16.2.0
nvm use 16.2.0
```

Finally, follow the steps below to set up and run ZeroChat.

#### üíª Installation and usage

Summary of the steps to be done:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rslay/ZeroChat zerochat
cd zerochat
npm install
# Make an .env file and change the config, if needed
cp .env.example .env
npm run start
```

Explanation:

- Download the repo to your machine: **`git clone https://github.com/rslay/ZeroChat zerochat`**
  - Enter the new directory with **`cd zerochat`**
- Install the dependencies for the project using **`npm install` or `yarn install`**
- Configure the environmental variables by renaming the `.env.example` file to `.env`, e.g. for defaults: **`cp .env.example .env`**
  - If you're using a Platform as a Service (PaaS), such as **AWS LightSail or Heroku**, configure it using the service's environment variables settings based of values in the `.env.example` file, and refrain from using the `.env` file
- Run the server using **`npm run start`**

## ‚ö† Common Issues

### Nginx Issues

Proxying the requests through **Nginx** can be a bit problematic, since you have to turn `proxy_buffering off;` in your `location {...}` block.

Example:
```conf
server {
        server_name chat.example.com;
        location / {
                proxy_buffering off; # Fixes the issue!
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; # ZeroChat server running locally on port 8000
        }
        listen 80; # Nginx listening on port 80
}
```
